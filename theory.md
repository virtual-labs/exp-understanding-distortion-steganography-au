 ## Theory
  <p>Distortion steganography is a technique used to embed information within digital media, such as images, while minimizing perceptible changes or distortions to the media content. This technique often utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) due to its efficiency in representing image data in the frequency domain.</p>

<h4>Key Concepts and Techniques</h4>



<h5>Frequency Domain Representation</h5>
    <p>To embed information into an image, it is first converted from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This process divides the image into small blocks (typically 8x8 pixels), with DCT applied separately to each block.</p>

<h5>Embedding Process</h5>
    <p>During embedding, selected DCT coefficients within the image blocks are modified to encode binary information. A common technique is modifying the least significant bits (LSBs) of DCT coefficients, minimizing visual changes while hiding data.</p>

<h5>Quantization </h5>
    <p>Quantization is crucial in steganography to control the precision of DCT coefficients. Adjusting quantization parameters ensures that embedded data does not degrade image quality noticeably, balancing between hiding capacity and perceptual fidelity.</p>

<h5>Inverse Transformation</h5>
    <p>After embedding, the inverse DCT transforms the modified frequency domain image back into the spatial domain, reconstructing the image with hidden information intact.</p>

<h5>Decoding</h5>
    <p>To retrieve hidden data, a decoding process reverses the embedding operations, extracting the embedded information while restoring the image to its original form.</p>

<h4>Additional Concepts in Steganography</h2>

<h5>Steganographic Techniques</h5>
    <p>Techniques include substitution (modifying bits or bytes of the carrier), transformation (modifying carrier properties), and generation (creating new carriers). These methods cater to various applications and levels of security in covert communication and digital watermarking.</p>

<h5>LSB Substitution</h5>
    <p>Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution involves replacing LSBs of pixels or audio samples with bits of hidden messages. It's a common and straightforward method in steganography.</p>

<h5>Visual and Statistical Attacks</h5>
    <p>Adversaries use visual and statistical analysis to detect steganographic content by examining changes in carrier appearance or statistical properties. Techniques like quantization analysis and histogram inspection aid in detecting hidden data.</p>

 <h5>Security and Applications</h5>
    <p>Steganography serves applications such as covert communication, data authentication, and copyright protection. Its security relies on robust embedding techniques and countermeasures against detection.</p>
