    {
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of covert communication that may use steganography?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Sending an encrypted email with a secure key exchange.",
        "b": "Hiding a message within the pixels of an image.",
        "c": "Using a VPN to secure internet browsing.",
        "d": "Signing a document with a digital certificate."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While encryption secures data, steganography hides data within other data.",
        "b": "Correct. Steganography conceals messages within seemingly innocuous carriers like images.",
        "c": "Incorrect. VPNs encrypt and secure network connections, but they do not hide messages within data.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Digital certificates validate the authenticity of documents but do not involve hiding messages."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a potential disadvantage of LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "High susceptibility to detection through statistical analysis.",
        "b": "Inability to embed large amounts of data.",
        "c": "Requires complex algorithms for embedding and extraction.",
        "d": "Limited compatibility with different file formats."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. LSB steganography can be susceptible to detection due to changes in LSBs affecting image statistics.",
        "b": "Incorrect. LSB techniques can embed small amounts of data effectively within images.",
        "c": "Incorrect. LSB methods are relatively straightforward compared to other steganographic techniques.",
        "d": "Incorrect. LSB steganography is generally compatible with various file formats."

      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "Which technique involves embedding data by subtly altering the color or brightness of image pixels?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "LSB Substitution",
        "b": "Transform Coding",
        "c": "Phase Coding",
        "d": "Spread Spectrum"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. LSB Substitution modifies the least significant bits of pixels, not their color or brightness.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Transform Coding uses mathematical transformations like DCT, not pixel color alterations.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Phase Coding alters phase information, not pixel color or brightness.",
        "d": "Correct. Spread Spectrum embeds data by subtly altering pixel attributes like color or brightness."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
